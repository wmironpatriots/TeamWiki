### Git (Required)

Versioning software that we use. Git is a CLI software, meaning you have to know terminal commands to use this. While this might seem unappealing, I find it to be easier and simple to use. However, if you're more comfortable using an app for this, you may use github desktop
* https://git-scm.com/downloads
* https://desktop.github.com/download/

### Game Tools (Optional)
