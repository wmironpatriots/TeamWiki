# Section A
Our codebase is written in java. While you don't need a crazy understanding of the language to contribute, you at least need to be able to read the syntax of java. If you already know java via APCS or other, you'll probably be able to move straight onto the homeworks.

Even though we may have 1-3 software meetings teaching java, you can self learn java by yourself if you want to get ahead!

### It's recommened that you use these guides if you want to self learn:
* [Java for Python Programmers](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/java4python/index.html) (RECOMENDED)
  * A great guide for people already expirenced in other programmming languages above python
* [Code Academy's Java course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) (RECOMENDED)
  * I totally recomend this if you have no expirence
* [Head First Java](https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4951/Head_First_Java_Second_Edition.pdf)
  * This guide is almost as massive as the pickle ditty meme (Almost)
  * If you're having trouble with concepts this can help break them down
  * You may use this but don't get too hung up with it please
