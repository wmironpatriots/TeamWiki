# Section A
Section A is a basic introduction to java.
Even though we may have 1-3 software meetings teaching java, you can self learn java by yourself if you want to get ahead!

It's recommened that you use these guides if you want to self learn:
* [Java for Python Programmers](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/java4python/index.html) (RECOMENDED)
  * A great guide for people already expirenced in other programmming languages above python
* [Code Academy's Java course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) (RECOMENDED)
  * I totally recomend this if you have no expirence
* [Head First Java](https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4951/Head_First_Java_Second_Edition.pdf)
  * This guide is almost as massive as the pickle ditty meme (Almost)
  * If you're having trouble with concepts this can help break them down
  * You may use this but don't get too hung up with it please
 
## Once you finish these, do the homework in our discord
