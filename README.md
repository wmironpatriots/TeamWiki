## 6423 Training Docs 1.0.0
A set of resources for getting started with FRC software

### Preface
The majority of FRC programming comes down to your ability to learn and use online documentation and resources. This guide won't grab your hand and guide you through everything, instead it will give you a good understanding of the basics and the resources that you can use to learn more. It will also provide you with some exercises that you can go through to refine your knowledge. 

If this guide is too slow for you feel free to take to reading more in the wpilib docs, they're a great place to further your knowledge.
If this guide is too fast for you feel free to ask more questions from me.
