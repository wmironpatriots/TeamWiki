## 6423 Training Docs
A set of resources for getting started with FRC software

### Preface
The majority of FRC programming comes down to your ability to learn and use online documentation and resources. This guide won't grab your hand and guide you through everything, instead it will give you a good understanding of the basics and the resources that you can use to learn more. It will also provide you with some exercises that you can go through to refine your knowledge. 

If you have trouble understanding some java or WPIlib concepts, before asking your software lead, you should check online. Check out the code of other teams, WPIlib documentation, or official FRC discord servers.
