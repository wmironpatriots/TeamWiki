## Preface
Welcome to the learning course. These docs exist to take you from almost zero to a good understanding of our workflows and practices.

Please note that you are expected to have some java knowledge (or at least some understanding of programming) before starting this course. There are two great resources that you can use for this

* **https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/java4python/index.html** (Java for python devs)
* **https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java** (15 hour code academy course)

If you've programmed before with other languages, I recomend using the Jav for python devs. Else, try the other link. Once you think you're ready, you can continue onto [Section A]()
